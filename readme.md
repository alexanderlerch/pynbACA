# TODO List:

## ```lesson0.ipynb```
### 0.Pre-require
- [x] Make sure the audio file is ready
- [x] I think it would be better to use the pyACA wavread function
- [x] Clear the warning 


### 1. Audio preproc

#### 1.1
- [x] Add downmixing step
- [ ] Bad audio example, would find a steroe file.
#### 1.2
- [x] Add normalization step

### 1. Block audio
- [x] Fixed the block audio visualization

### 2. Spectrogram
#### 2.2 FFT
- [ ] While I like this, I wonder if it is maybe too detailed for the main audience. Ultimately, nobody will implement an FFT... (Maybe we can discuss this in the next meeing)
#### 2.3 STFT 
- [x] Plot a spectrogram also with log magnitude
- [x] Plot a Mel spectrogram, too


## ```dataset.py```
- [ ] license issue for download scripts: https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/tonas
- [ ] AL: it might be easiest to just use the files that I am always using from the slides: https://github.com/alexanderlerch/ACA-Slides/tree/2nd_edition/audio, particularly sax_example.mp3

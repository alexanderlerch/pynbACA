# TODO List:

## ```lesson0.ipynb```
### 0.Pre-require
[ ]- Make sure the audio file is ready
[X]- I think it would be better to use the pyACA wavread function
[X]- Clear the warning 


### 1. Audio preproc

#### 1.1
[X]- Add downmixing step
[]- Bad audio example, would find a steroe file.
#### 1.2
[X]- Add normalization step

### 1. Block audio
[X] - Fixed the block audio visualization

### 2. Spectrogram
#### 2.2 FFT
[ ] While I like this, I wonder if it is maybe too detailed for the main audience. Ultimately, nobody will implement an FFT... (Maybe we can discuss this in the next meeing)
#### 2.3 STFT 
[X] Plot a spectrogram also with log magnitude
[X] Plot a Mel spectrogram, too
